# Arduino-based-Fire-Fighting-Robot
An Arduino-based autonomous fire-fighting robot that detects flames using IR sensors, navigates toward the fire with 4WD differential steering, and extinguishes it by spraying water from an onboard pump. Features precise nozzle control via servo and safe high-current switching with relays.
